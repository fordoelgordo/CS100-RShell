# Introduction
This program will be able to generate an executable that when exercised takes in user input and executes any of the executable programs located in the PATH environment variable locations.  The composite design pattern will be followed, meaning that the client will have a simple and intuitive interface to work with that will hide all unnecessary functional implmentation from the user.
